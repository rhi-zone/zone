# TODO

## In Progress

- **Iris** - Agent-authored insights. Extract and share knowledge from coding sessions. See [design doc](/docs/design/iris.md).

## Backlog

- Rename `agent/` to `wisteria/` (climbing vine, tendrils reaching and exploring - fits autonomous task execution)
  - Update nursery.toml, init.lua requires, CLAUDE.md references
  - Lower priority: risks context rot if done mid-work

## Future Projects

Flora is a monorepo for Lua-based tools. Planned additions:
- **File browser** - File system navigation
- **Note editor** - Note taking/editing

## Naming

Botanical theme - apps are flowers:
- agent -> wisteria (decided)
- iris (new - agent insights/blogging)
- file browser -> ?
- note editor -> ?
