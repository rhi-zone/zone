## In Progress

- **Iris** - Agent-authored insights. Extract and share knowledge from coding sessions. See [design doc](/docs/design/iris.md).


### [x] Update CLAUDE.md — corrections as documentation lag (2026-03-29)

Add to the corrections section:
> **Corrections are documentation lag, not model failure.** When the same mistake recurs, the fix is writing the invariant down — not repeating the correction. Every correction that doesn't produce a CLAUDE.md edit will happen again. Exception: during active design, corrections are the work itself — don't prematurely document a design that hasn't settled yet.

Add to the Session Handoff section:
> **Initiate a handoff after a significant mid-session correction.** When a correction happens after substantial wrong-path work, the wrong reasoning is still in context and keeps pulling. Writing down the invariant and starting fresh beats continuing with poisoned context — the next session loads the invariant from turn 1 before any wrong reasoning exists.

Conventional commit: `docs: add corrections-as-documentation-lag + context-poisoning handoff rule`

## Future Projects

Zone is a monorepo for Lua-based tools. Planned additions:
- **File browser** - File system navigation
- **Note editor** - Note taking/editing

## Naming

Botanical theme - apps are flowers:
- wisteria - autonomous task execution
- iris - agent insights/blogging
- file browser -> ?
- note editor -> ?
